### File structure

This project tries to utilize the [clean code architecture](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) by uncle bob to attain a serparation of concerns, testablility(shown at tests/unit) and maintainability.

Some important structures of the project:

- src/user-cases: Business logic utilized by controller
- src/services: Services used in the use-cases, such as the database service which is the data lawyer
- src/controllers: API controllers
- src/core: Contains the earliest and most independent parts of the project such as the entities, dtos, abstractions and interfaces.
- tests/: Contains some feature and unit tests

```

```
